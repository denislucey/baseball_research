# Summary
Uhhh just some python code i wrote up this summer (2023) cuz I was bored. Attempts to create a basic record forecast system for baseball. The goal was to create a system that was more accurate at predicting records that Pythagorean win loss. I think it does that. But I'm not enough of a stats guy to say for sure

# Methodology
Instead of predicting W/L% based upon total RS and total RA, looks at individual game totals.
